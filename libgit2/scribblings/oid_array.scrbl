 Free the OID array

 This method must (and must only) be called on git_oidarray objects where the array is allocated by the library. Not doing so, will result in a memory leak.

 This does not free the git_oidarray itself, since the library will never allocate that object directly itself (it is more commonly embedded inside another struct or created on the stack).
