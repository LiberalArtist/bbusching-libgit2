          [custom_headers strarray?])
         integer?]{
 Open a connection to a remote

 The transport is selected based on the URL. The direction argument is due to a limitation of the git protocol (over TCP or SSH) which starts up a specific binary which can only do the one or the other.

 Check whether the remote's underlying transport is connected to the remote host.

         integer?]{
 Retrieve the name of the remote's default branch

 The default branch of a repository is the branch which HEAD points to. If the remote does not support reporting this information directly, it performs the guess as git does; that is, if there are multiple branches which point to the same commit, the first one is chosen. If the master branch is a candidate, it wins.

 This function must only be called after connecting.

@defproc[(git_remote_dup
          [source remote?])
         remote?]{
 Create a copy of an existing remote. All internal strings are also duplicated. Callbacks are not duplicated.

          [remote remote?])
         any]{
 Get the remote repository's reference advertisement list

 Get the list of references with which the server responds to a new connection.

 The remote (or more exactly its transport) must have connected to the remote repository. This list is available as soon as the connection to the remote is initiated and it remains available after disconnecting.

 The memory belongs to the remote. The pointer will be valid as long as a new connection is not initiated, but it is recommended that you make a copy in order to make use of the data.

 Returns @racket[(values (out : (_cpointer remote_head?))
                         (size : integer?))]. See @secref["values" #:doc '(lib "scribblings/reference/reference.scrbl")]
